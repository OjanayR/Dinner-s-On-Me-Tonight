## Dinner's On Me Tonight

'Dinner's On Me Tonight' is an app that allows the user to choose meals at the click of a  button...literally. 
Click on the "TACO' button and a page will appear that inclues, 
- A picture of the meal
- The nationality of the dish
- List of ingredients
- A YouTube video with visual instructions to help the user prepare the meal.

If you are not satisfied with the (spontaneous) choice, click on the TACO button again for a new meal.
