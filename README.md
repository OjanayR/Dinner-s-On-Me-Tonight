## Dinner's On Me Tonight

'Dinner's On Me Tonight' is an app that allows the user to choose meals at the click of a  button...literally. 
Click on the "TACO' button and a page will appear that includes, 
- A picture of the meal
- The nationality of the dish
- List of ingredients
- A YouTube video with visual instructions to help the user prepare the meal.

If you are not satisfied with the (spontaneous) choice, click on the TACO button again for a new meal.

### Unsolved Problems
A road block I came across what uploading the "Ingredients" into my application. I used a few different arrays, consulted with my Team's Lead, classmates and attended office hours. I will continue to work with JavaScript to display the listed ingredients from the API.

### Favorite 
Adding the 'taco' emojis and including the YouTube link.
